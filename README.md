# Soulsario
 "Soulsario" is a amateur game created for learning purposes in C# and Windows Form Application. The game is themed around Dark Souls and serves as an analog to the iconic Mario game. Currently, there are only two levels with classic mechanics. The pre-alpha version includes graphical errors, glitches, and many unfinished tabs.

Attention, due to the requirements of the copyright holders of the artistic part, they were not added, so you will not be able to try the game.
